# Cole Gentry - Coding Challenge

Hey Bottomline devs I built this wack a mole game with a little twist on it since in my free time I restore old Mini Coopers. You will find the Whack A Mini game enclosed. Try your luck at bonking as many minis as you can. I also did my best to make it match the bottomline colors and styles from the homepage. Thanks so much for the consideration!

**Notes:**

- `gulp` toolset was created specifically for this project
- `editorconfig`, and `eslintrc.js` are based off my personal preferences but I am flexible to company patterns

## To run this locally

- Open terminal
- Install `gulp-cli` globally `npm install -g gulp-cli`
- `cd` to the directory
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Run default command `gulp`
- Browser will open and you can test the code live
